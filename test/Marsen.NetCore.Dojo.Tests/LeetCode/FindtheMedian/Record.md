## 題目

The median of a list of numbers is essentially it's middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, can you find the median?

For example, the median of arr [1,2,3,4,5] is 3, the middle element in the sorted array.

should return 2 ,
目的 : 自 array 中取值 

### arr = [1,2,3]
should return 2,
目的 : 取出 array 的中間值

### arr = [2,3,1]
should return 2
目的 : Sort array

### arr = [0,1,2,4,6,5,3]
should return 3
